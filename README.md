<h1>MA2012 Introduction to Mechatronics Systems Design: NFC-Enabled Medicine Dispenser</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In the MA2011 Introduction to Mechatronics Systems Design, our group conceptualized a revolutionary non-contact medicine
dispenser utilizing NFC technology. This innovative system accurately identifies each patient's medication needs,
eliminating the necessity for a traditional pharmacy. The project's success was underscored by achieving a prestigious
top-three position in the cohort, showcasing the practical impact of our solution in healthcare automation. I coded the
system using C++ and orchestrated its functionality with 4 Arduinos and multiple motors, reflecting the project's depth
and technical sophistication.
